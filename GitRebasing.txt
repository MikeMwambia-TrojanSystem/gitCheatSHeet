Git Rebasing : - 

Rewrites history.
History becomes linear every commit has single parent.
Doesn't keep entire history of all commits.
Merging of the feature branch into base branch using rebasing is two step process.

Rebasing is a two step process : - 

First checkout a branch say 'feature' branch

git checkout feature

Make changes and commit on this branch.
Then rebase the checked out branch on top of base branch say 'master'

git rebase master

Then check out the base branch in this case master 

git checkout master

Merge working branch in this case 'feature' branch into the base branch in this case master

git merge feature

After the above process Fast forward merge will be used

Git --- Detached HEAD 

Git head points to the currently checked out branch.

When you move the HEAD from the currently checked out branch and it points to a specific commit 
that means it has moved to detached HEAD state.

git checkout <SHA1> --------- Checks out commit for <SHA1>  

Moving the repo into detached head state

Commits made in detached HEAD state will be garbage collected

git branch -d <branchname> ------- Deletes the branch name

Git hooks 
These scrips run on hooks and allows Git to perform checks at every point of the process.

Example hooks : - 
If the hooks exit with 0 it means they have excecuted successfully 

Pre-commit hook --- This is a hook that is excecuted before a commit is made.

Prepare commit msg hook 

Commit-msg hook

Post-commit hook

Uses of Git Hooks : - 

- Verify or edit commit message

- Run application tests before each commit or before pushing to remote

- Verify and potentially fix code syntax mistakes using linters like ESLint

- Generate notifications after successful committing

- Deploy updated application to production on the server

NB:- Git creates sample hookd when you initialize a new Git repository,
but all those sample hooks are disabled by default
Local Git hooks are not pushed to remote automatically they are local.

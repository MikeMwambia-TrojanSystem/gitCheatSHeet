To push to remote repositories you use 

git push

If your local branch and remote branch is the same name then you 
can just do it :

git push origin branchName

When your local and remote branch name is different then you
can just do :

git push origin localBranchName : remoteBranchName

git branch -r  ----- returns all the remote branches

NB: - origin is not the remote repository name.It is rather a local alias 
set as a key in place of the remote repository URL.
